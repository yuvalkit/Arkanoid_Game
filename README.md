Arkanoid_Game

This is an Arkanoid game I made from scratch using Java for "Intro to OOP" course.

In this game, you control the movement of a paddle and each level your goal is to destroy all the blocks with a few given balls.
If you lose all the balls, you lose 1 life.
This game has several different levels with different interesting designs.
